**Steps Involved**

1) Importing the required Libraries
2) Reading the Dataset File
3) Exploring the data to find missing values
4) Treating the Missing Values
5) Checking the data Type and Correct those data to the format neeeded for Analysis
6)  Analysing  Correlation of "Churn" with other variables
7) Data Exploration - Gender Distribution / Senior Citizens / Partner and dependent status / Contracts / Services etc
8)  Finding out the Churn for the above
9) Develop Models like -  Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM and ADA Boost

**Libraries Used**

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.ticker
4) matplotlib.pyplot
5) sklearn.model_selection
6) sklearn.linear_model
7) sklearn - Metrices
8) sklearn.ensemble

**Summary** 
We have successfully Train, Tested and calculated the accuracy

**Models Used **
 Logistic Regression — fast and linear model
Random Forest — slower but accurate ensemble model based on decision trees
 Support Vector Machines — slower but accurate
